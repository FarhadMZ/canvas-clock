# 🕒 Canvas Clock (Mini Project)

This is a simple clock created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

> 🧑‍🎓 This mini project was made by a 14-year-old student as part of a training assignment. I was so impressed by their enthusiasm and effort that I decided to share it publicly to encourage them and others who are learning to code.

✅ A great example for beginners to explore:
- Canvas API
- Drawing arcs
- Basic animations
- Working with date and time in JavaScript

🧠 Feel free to fork, use, and share it for learning purposes!
